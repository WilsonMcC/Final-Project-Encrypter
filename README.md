## Final-Project-Encrypter
This is my final project for Programming for IT CIS-153. This python program uses different imports such as cryptography, base64, and fernet to create a encrypted message or file. First, the user is prompted if they want to encrypt or decrypt a message/file. If chooseing encrypt the user must select which type of encryption from a selection of different types. After the user selects, the message/file is saved and a key is generated. This key can then be used to decrypt the message/file later.
